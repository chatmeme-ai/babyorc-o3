Analyze the following document to determine if it aligns with the provided business strategy, mission, and vision.

BUSINESS STRATEGY:
${businessStrategy}

MISSION AND VISION:
${missionVision}

DOCUMENT CONTENT:
${documentText}

Provide a detailed analysis including:
1. An overall alignment score (0-100%)
2. A summary of how well the document aligns with the business strategy
3. Key points of alignment and misalignment
4. Specific recommendations to improve alignment
5. A comprehensive point-by-point analysis of the document

Focus on evaluating whether the document's content, tone, objectives, and proposed actions align with the stated business strategy, mission, and vision.
